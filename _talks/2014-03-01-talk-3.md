Understanding the transport of nuclides in fractured rocks is crucial for ensuring biosphere safety, -as geological barriers serve as the final line of defense against nuclide transport. In this study, I constructed a discrete fracture network (DFN) model based on authentic data from the prototype repository at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) in Sweden. The model was used to simulate nuclide transport using particle tracking methods and to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution following nuclide leakage. The DFN model provides detailed fracture characteristics, enabling more precise predictions. To ensure accurate risk assessment, it is necessary to consider parameter uncertainty for the additional parameters. A Sobol variance decomposition global sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of fracture parameters on flow rates, transport distances, and parameter interactions.
